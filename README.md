# FLUX.1-schnell multi-LoRA Explorer Cog Model

This is an implementation of [black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-schnell) as a [Cog](https://github.com/replicate/cog) model.

Named multi-LoRA Explorer, to explore the model with different LoRA weights.

## Development

Follow the [model pushing guide](https://replicate.com/docs/guides/push-a-model) to push your own model to [Replicate](https://replicate.com).


## How to use

Make sure you have [cog](https://github.com/replicate/cog) installed.

To run a prediction:

    cog predict -i prompt="a photo of TOK, sftsrv style" -i extra_loras=["lucataco/flux-queso","https://huggingface.co/alvdansen/softserve_anime/resolve/main/flux_dev_softstyle_araminta_k.safetensors"]

NOTE: Flux Dev LORAs often work fine with Flux Schnell. LORAs will saturate the model at the same weights as they would with Dev, so use lower weights with Schnell than you normally would with Dev.
